Some animals’ coloration uses bold, disruptive markings to scare predators. Other animals have color patterns that blend with their surroundings. Such coloration serves for protection, to attract mates, 
or to distract enemies. Called cryptic coloration, it uses the animals’ living place, habits, 
and means of defense. Cryptic coloration may blend an animal so well with its environment that 
it is virtually invisible.
